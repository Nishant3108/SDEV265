M02 Project Plan
  1.)  Introduction - the introduction should briefly describe the objectives of the project and set out any constraints of the project
The goal of this project is to develop a game using C++ and SFML within a six-week timeframe, starting no later than the end of this week. The game will focus on player movement, 
lighting and shadow mechanics, enemy AI, and interactive puzzle elements. Our goal is to create an engaging experience where players navigate an environment while avoiding detection
by strategically manipulating light sources.
The project will be developed in phases, starting with the basic game mechanics in a console environment before integrating SFML for graphics rendering. 
This process is still being analyzed to determine whether it is too ambitious within our limited timeframe. Currently, several key elements of the game 
have been identified, including a 2D grid movement system, real-time lighting and shadow rendering, patrolling enemies that react to player visibility,
and interactive objects that impact the game world. Realistically, our goal is to create at least one level that meets these characteristics.
A structured development plan ensures efficiency, with specific tasks assigned to each team member. Nishant is the project manager, José handles documentation,
Tucker develops UML diagrams and programming logic, and César researches and implements SFML-based designs. The project's feasibility has been assessed, taking into account technical, legal, and economic constraints. Given the available resources and the structured timeline, we anticipate completing the project within the allotted six weeks. Through iterative development, testing, and collaboration, this project aims to deliver a functional and engaging stealth game prototype that will involve everyone's participation, supporting our coding colleagues. We hope to achieve our goals.

        Short description of the activity
        Estimate the time it will take to complete the activity
        List of any activities on which the current activity relies (dependencies)
M02 Risk Assessment Document
  We will discuss this in more detail this Wednesday 3-26
M02 Feasibility Study
  1.) Is this plan technically feasible?
Yes, the hardware and software requirements are not overboard, and everyone on the team has the proper equipment. Some challenges include the implementation of real-time illumination and the SFML.
  2.) Is this plan legal?
Yes, we are not engaging in any piracy or using unauthorized hardware or software.
  3.) Is this plan operationally feasible?
It would require considerable effort, given the limited time and limited knowledge, but as a team, we will overcome these challenges.
  4. Is this plan feasible within a reasonable timeframe?  
      Yes, within the next 6 weeks, it should be feasible, especially if we finalize the Project plan by week one. With an estimated 15 hours of programming, 5 hours of documenting, and 10 hours of learning and coding using SFML. 8 hours in team meetings.
5.) Is this plan economically feasible?
From an economic perspective, this project is designed with cost efficiency in mind. The projected profit is not measured in direct revenue since this is a prototype and learning project rather than a commercial product. However, its actual value lies in the skills development and proof-of-concept demonstration for potential future projects.
Since we are using tools such as Trellol, GitHub, C++, and SFML, the capital investment is primarily the time spent working on the project behind the screen rather than a financial investment.
Therefore, the cost-benefit analysis is positive; we must work on a project as a team that requires effort, and we gain valuable experience.
6.) Does the system contribute to the overall objectives of the organization?
Yes, the system aligns well with the broader objectives of the organization by:
Practice: The project offers the team an opportunity to enhance their skills in C++ and modern game development techniques using SFML.

Demonstrating Innovation: By developing a prototype that integrates dynamic gameplay elements, including lighting, enemy AI, and puzzles, the project showcases the organization’s capability to innovate and implement complex systems.
Supporting Collaborative Growth: With defined roles and collaborative tools, the project is based on teamwork and learning.
Setting a Foundation for Future Projects: The prototype can serve as a stepping stone for more extensive, potentially marketable projects in the future.
7.) Can the system be implemented within the schedule and budget using current technology?
The system is designed to be implemented within a six-week timeframe by leveraging modern, widely available technologies:

Current Technology: The use of C++ and SFML, along with a phased approach that starts from basic mechanics and progresses to more complex systems, including lighting, enemy AI, and puzzles, is structured to facilitate iterative development and early testing. Finally, we primarily use open-source tools, so the budget is not a significant concern for this project.

8. Can the system be integrated with other systems that are currently in use?
Integration is feasible given the modular design and use of standard libraries. The project is structured into distinct modules (player movement, lighting, enemy AI, and puzzle mechanics), allowing individual components to be updated or integrated independently.
Using industry-standard tools like Git for version control and Trellol for project management facilitates.
The system’s codebase, built on open standards (C++ and SFML), enables it to be easily integrated with other software systems, whether for further game development or educational platforms. While the project is a prototype, its architecture supports extension and refinement, ensuring it can interoperate with future modules or systems developed by the organization.
